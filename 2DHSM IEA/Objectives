IEA_2DHSM : class to apply 2dhsm encryption technique to an array of (grayscale) pixels
    -completed: initializing 2d_hsm chaotic variables
                adding random pixel border to image
                making s1 and s2 chaotic matrix
                encryption
    -to do:     make program for rgb images
                create a git repos to version control

EncryptImage : class to manage images and display results
    -completed: reading image from file
                creating image from matrix of pixels
    -convert pixel array into image and display it in the same window
    -later on: analyse the encryption using the techniques highlighted in the paper

!CORRECTIONS MADE!
    1. Decryption algorithm will shift ith row right to left and jth column bottom to top
    2. Access s[l] in opposite orders in encryption and decryption
    3. encrypt : l=1, m=2; decrypt : l=2, m=1

1/12/23:
    Fixed transposition functions (cycleShiftLR/RL/BT/TB)
    Fixed diffusion 1
    have to do:
    >Fix diffusion 2
    >Fix order of operations in encryption/decryption
    >make UI for encryption and decyption
    >Add analysing program to UI
    >make things pretty.
    possible error in paper with diffusion 2.
